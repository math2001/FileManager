This page will list every command available and explain what they do with *every single* options.

## Common features

Because FileManager uses an API, you'll always get those following feature in every input panel
that is shown by FileManager.

### The Auto Completion system

All the input that are created from File Manager have an auto completions system. If you want to
learn more about about it, [here's the page dedicated to it](references/auto-completion.md)

### The log in the status bar

As you probably noticed, when you create a file, there is in the side bar a message, like this

`Creating at <path>`

!!! note
    Of course, the the `Creating` will change if you're moving, renaming, duplicating etc.

And the path is in a *computer friendly form* ([more info](references/type-of-path.md)), but you
can change it so that it is in a *user friendly form*.

```json
"log_in_status_bar": "user"
```

The valid values are `"computer"`, `"user"` and `false`

If it is set to `false`, it will be disabled (there will be no log in the status bar)

### The "browser"

If you try to create a file that already exists, it will simply open it.

!!! note
    This is a trick that I realised I was using very often! It's even better when you use
    [aliases](references/aliases.md)

But what happens if you try to create a **folder** that already exists? Well it's going to show up
a quick panel with every folders and every files listed. If you pick a file, it will open it. If
you pick a folder, it will reopen the browser listing all the items of this folder.

There is two more options. The first one is `..`, to go up of one folder, and the other one is:
`Create form here`. If you pick this option, it will simply reopen the input panel from your
position in the browser.

So, again, this is just theory. Read on discover the different commands that uses those features
(and, of course, add their own :wink:)

## Create

Command: `fm_create`

You can access it from 2 different ways:

### Right click on a file/folder in the side bar and choose `New`

![FileManager::create from sidebar context menu](/imgs/create-multi.gif)

With this option, you will create *from where you click*. If it was a file, you will create from
its *containing folder*.

You should see an input at the bottom of sublime text. You can type a file name or a path, and it
will create it for you. You can use what I call [user friendly path](references/type-of-path.md)

#### Example

`folder/file.py`

If `folder` does not exists, then it will create it for you.  
If `file.py` exists, it will open it, otherwise it will create it, and then open it.

Note: To create an empty folder, append `/` at the end of name. Otherwise, it will create only file.    
for folder - `folder/`  
for file   - `file.py` or `folder/file.py`  

### With a shortcut `alt+n`

![FileManager::create from shortcut](/imgs/relative.gif)

When you use a shortcut, the plugin does not explicitly know from where you want to create. Here's
how it **guesses**:

1. If there is some folders open in Sublime Text, it will create from the top one
2. Otherwise, if there is file open, it will create from its containing folder
3. Finally, it will choose `~` . You can change this fall back by adding to your settings the key
`path_fallback` with the path you want

> If there is some folders open in Sublime Text, it will create from the top one

If you want to select which folder you want to create from, you can just add this prefix: `nb>`

#### Example

- `0>file.py` Creates from the first folder, starting from the top. Here the prefix is useless,
because it's the default value (you could have just typed `file.py`)
- `1>file.py` Creates from the second folder, starting from the top
- `-1>file.py` Creates from the first folder, starting from the **bottom**

You get the idea.

!!! note
    Watch out, they're "code lists", which means that they start from `0`. `0` is the first one,
    `1` is the second, `2` is the third, etc...

### Changing the symbol (`>`)

I personally don't like typing the `>`, because I have to move my hand a looooong way :smile:. So,
I added an option to change it. For my part, I chose a space. The only "problem" is that if I have
the following structure:

```
test/
    1 python/
samples/
    hello/
    index.html
```

And that I want to create a file in the folder `1 python`, I'm going to type something line this
`1 python/afile.py`. But, it's going select in `samples`. **So**, you would have to explicitly say
that you want to create from the first folder, so: `0 1 python/afile.py` would work.

But, it's not that much of a big deal, because you rarely get a folder starting with a number and
then a space, and as you saw, the solution is really simple.

Why isn't `>`  a problem too? On Windows at least, you can **not** have a file are a folder that has
`>` in it.

So, if you want to change the symbol, add this to your settings user
(it can be, of course, whatever you want):

```json
"index_folder_separator": " "
```

### Changing the default index

As I said earlier, the default index is `0`. You can change this by adding this to your settings

```json
"default_index": 1
```

### Templates

You can specify templates so that when you create a new file, the content will be the content of
your template. For more information, see [the page dedicated to the templates](references/templates.md)

## Rename

Command: `fm_rename`

You can only rename **1** file at a time.

If you put a slash in your name, it will automatically create a sub-folders to it, and then move
the file. For example, if you try to rename a file like this: `hello/world.py` and your file is
called `something.py`, it will create the folder `hello` (if it doesn't already exists) and then
rename `something.py`.

!!! tip
    If your name is `../hello.py`, it will move your file one folder above.

## Move

Command: `fm_move`

You can move several items at a time. If they aren't in the same folder, the path shown in the
input will be the common path they have. Once you'll move them, **they'll be in every cases in
the same folder**.

To move a file, you're oblige to use the browser, because you have to choose an existing folder, so
it will automatically pop up. But if you have a look, instead of having `[cmd]: Create from here`,
you have `[cmd]: move here`. As you probably guessed, you have to select this option to move your
file/folder

## Duplicate

Command: `fm_duplicate`

You can duplicate folders and files, but, once again, one at a time.

!!! note
    If you're duplicating a folder, you *must* create a new folder.

## Delete

Command: `fm_delete`

File Manager doesn't delete permanently your files/folders, it only throws them to the trash.

!!! note
    When other commands needs to overwrite a file or a folders, they throw them to the trash
    *before* and then simply write.

## Create from selection

Command: `fm_create_from_selection`

As its name says, this command allows you to create a file from text. For example, in `html`, if
you right click on the value of an `src` or `href` attribute, an option will appear called
`Create <the path to you file>` (it will be shorten if it's too long). You don't even need to
select anything.

If you do select something, then it will propose you to create the file using the path you've
selected.

Here's an example:

![FileManager::create_from_selection](/imgs/create_from_selection.png)

*Font: Droid Sans Mono; Theme: Boxy; Color Scheme: Boxy Yesterday*

In every cases, the file will be created *from* the current file (so this command does not appear
if you're file is not saved on the disk).

!!! note
    This automatic selection only works, for now, in the following languages:

    - html
    - python
    - php
    - javascript
    - ruby

    If you'd like to see an other language supported, feel free to submit a [new issue][], or even
    to create it yourself. Please make sure you read the [contribution-guide][] before doing so.

## Open in browser

Command: `fm_open_in_browser`

This command opens up the selected file in the default browser. You can run it from the command
palette: `File Manager: Open In Browser`, it'll open the current file. You can also run it from the
Side Bar: it'll open the selected file(s).

It also kind of *overwrites* the default `Open in browser` option in the context menu (in fact, it
hides default command, and shows the FileManager's command). Now, you might be wondering:

> Why do an other command, while an other one exists?

Well, this one is better :smile:. Here's how: *it takes into account a global setting* `url`

An example's a great way to explain how it works (in `MyProject.sublime-project`):

```json
{
    "folders": [
        {
            "path": "C:/wamp/www/MyAwesomeWebsite/"
        }
    ],
    "settings": {
        "url": "http://localhost/MyAwesomeWebsite/"
    }
}
```

Now, when you're going to open a file that is in the the folder `C:/wamp/www/MyAwesomeWebsite/`,
it'll simply replace this part with the `url` value (here `http://localhost/MyAwesomeWebsite/`)

#### Examples

- `C:/wamp/www/MyAwesomeWebsite/index.html` → `http://localhost/MyAwesomeWebsite/` (it's clever,
it removes the `index.html`)
- `C:/wamp/www/MyAwesomeWebsite/index.php` → `http://localhost/MyAwesomeWebsite/`
- `C:/wamp/www/MyAwesomeWebsite/sub-folder/file.php` →
`http://localhost/MyAwesomeWebsite/sub-folder/file.php`

## Open Terminal Here

Command: `fm_open_terminal`

It opens up the terminal in the selected folder (or the folder of the current file if you open it
from the command palette). You can configure what's happening in your FileManager's settings
(*Preferences → Packages Settings → FileManager*).

You can add a setting called `terminals`. Here's the format:

```json
{
    "terminals": [
        {
            "name": "terminal name",
            "cmd": ["the", "command", "to", "open"],
            "platform": "first second"
        },
        {
            "name": "An other Terminal",
            "cmd": ["terminal", "--new_tab", "$cwd"]
        }
    ]
}
```

In the `cmd` key, you have one variable: `$cwd`. It'll be replaced by the *current working dir*
(the folder from which the command will be run).

The `platform` is used to limit allow the terminal to work only one specific platform(s). If it is
omitted, it'll work on every platform. The valid values are `windows`, `linux` and `osx`.

!!! tip
    You can limit a terminal to work on multiple platform by seperating them with a space, like so:
    `windows osx`


### Windows example

```json
{
    "terminals": [
        {
            "name": "Cmder",
            "cmd": ["C:/cmder/cmder.exe", "/SINGLE", "$cwd"],
            "platform": "windows"
        },
        {
            "name": "CMD",
            "cmd": ["cmd"],
            "platform": "windows"
        }
    ]
}
```

If you don't know what [Cmder](http://cmder.net) is, you might want to have a look (for Windows
user). [Hyper](https://hyper.is) is also pretty cool, since it's a web based terminal.

### MacOS example

```json
{
    "terminals": [
        {
            "name": "iTerm",
            "platform": "osx",
            "cmd": ["open", "-a", "iTerm", "$cwd"]
        },
        {
            "name": "Terminal",
            "platform": "osx",
            "cmd": ["open", "-a", "Terminal", "$cwd"]
        }
    ]
}
```

If it does, doesn't and you have a solution, or needs improvement, please let me know by
[raising an issue][new-issue].

!!! Tip
    If none of these works for you, and you don't know how to configure this, you can always use
    Will Bond's package [Terminal][] and [hide this option (open terminal here)](references/settings.md)

## Open In Explorer

Command: `fm_open_in_explorer`

This command simply opens the selected item(s) in your file explorer (or finder if you're on mac).
It'll open the current file if it's run from the command palette.
